# Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets using machine learning techniques. A Random Forest Classifier model is trained to predict sentiment (positive or negative) based on tweet text. The model is deployed in a user-friendly Streamlit application, enabling users to input their text and receive sentiment analysis results instantly.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and vectorizing tweet text using TF-IDF.
- **Model Training**: Training a Random Forest Classifier to predict sentiment.
- **Deployment**: A Streamlit application for real-time sentiment analysis.
  
## Usage
- **Enter text into the provided text area in the Streamlit app.
- **Click "Analyze Sentiment" to predict the sentiment (Positive/Negative).
- **View the results along with your original text.

## System Requirements
- **Python 3.8 or higher
- **Required Python libraries: streamlit, joblib, sklearn, pandas, re

## Troubleshooting
- **Ensure all required packages are installed.
- **Verify that paths to the model and vectorizer files are correct.
